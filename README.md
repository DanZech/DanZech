### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 

My name is ***Daniel*** and for nearly 20 years, I worked as a ***Lawyer*** with a ***Masters degree in Constitutional and Labor Law***. However, I recently decided to make a career switch and move into the world of IT.

So far, I have been focusing on learning HTML, CSS, and some Python. However, my current focus is mastering GIT and GITHUB. This is the reason why I am currently working on my README.MD presentation and soon I hope to create a webpage.

I would like to invite you to follow my journey as I navigate through the challenges of learning and starting something new from scratch. I am eager to learn from others, so if you have any insights or tips to share, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my GitHub presentation. Let's connect and learn from each other!
