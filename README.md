### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 

I am Daniel and for almost two decades I used to be a Lawyer, M.Sc. Constitutional/Labor Law, who decided to move to the IT path. So far I have learned HTML, CSS, and some Python. Right now I am trying to master GIT and GITHUB, and this is the reason I am working on the README.MD presentation, and soon we will have a webpage (I hope!!). Well, you can follow my journey of learning and starting something new from scratch, and even better if you can teach me something. Thanks a lot!

Skills: HTML / CSS / Python (on going)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project named Warehouse, using Python. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any tip is welcome (bier too).  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to combine lawyer and Dev mindset. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dani.zech@gmail.com 
- âš¡ Fun fact: role play on a TV advertisement
